Hello World!

# _Travel Journal_

## This is a static webpage built using [React](https://react.dev/)

This is my first project built using React!
Inspiration: [Learn React with Bob Ziroll](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

### Open terminal and run the following command

```sh
$npm run dev
```

This will run up the React app on `localhost:portnumber`. Open the link in browser to view the webpage.
